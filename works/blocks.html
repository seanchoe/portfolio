<p>Blocks is an iOS app that can help you control children's smart phone usage. Parents can monitor children's activities from their own phones.</p>

	<p>Once the parent initiates an Instant or a Scheduled Goal, the child receives a notification. If the child opens the device while the goal is going on, it fails. If they don't use the device until the goal is finished, they earn the "Blocks" as reward.</p>

	<p>Instead of forcing to stop using the phone, our approach was to give positive rewards to children if they use their phones less. Initially we designed it to give "Trophies" as rewards to children, which are like digital stickers.</p>

	<p>However when we did a survey with these trophy designs, our customers gave us feedbacks that their children are not motivated by them. So we have decided to change them to real-life rewards that parents can set for their children.</p>
