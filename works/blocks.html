<p>After launching DinnerTime Plus and QualityTime, we've got a lot of requests from customers that they want a parental control app for iOS.</p>

<p>iOS has much more restrictions than Android, so we had to approach in a different way. Instead of completely blocking the phone usage, we decide to give positive rewards to kid if they complete the goals that parents set.</p>
