<p>DinnerTime Plus an app with real-time remote monitoring and parental control features to manage and take control of children's smart device usage habits and addiction.</p>

<p>Child's app is for Android and parent's app is for both iOS and Android. I designed UI for both and developed iOS app.</p>

<p>DinnerTime Plus started from our own needs. Many of my colleagues have kids and they had experiences of having hard time to make kids stop looking at the phones and have dinner together.</p>

<p>We thought, "What if there's an app that blocks all kid's phone with just one tap of a button?". So we made DinnerTime Plus.</p>
