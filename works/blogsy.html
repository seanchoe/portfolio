<p>We made it from our own needs. When we had our iPads for the first time, we wanted a nice, easy-to-use blogging app for iPad. But we couldn't find one, so we started to develop Blogsy.</p>

<p>It once had been ranked 32nd total, and 2nd top grossing app in social networking category in U.S. App Store.</p>

<p>I designed the whole UI and developed the most UI part of the code.</p>

<p>We had a mascot for Blogsy called Fomo. Every major update we did, we put a name of a mythical creature and added an image of Fomo in it's shape.</p>
